visitor","4160":"i muttered","4161":"#NAME?","4162":"are we scared yet","4163":"bart hes establishing mood","4164":"ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember

the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore -- nameless here for evermore","4168":"aag","4169":"and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with

this mystery explore --","4185":"open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door -- perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door -- perched and sat and nothing more","4186":"though

still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamp-light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted -- nevermore","4214":"lisa that wasnt scary not even for a poem","4215":"well it was written in

that its a bad influence on children","5593":"oh give me a break i think that is a bunch of baloney and heres why in preparing for this debate i did a little research and i discovered a startling thing there was violence in the past long before cartoons were invented","5594":"i see fascinating","5595":"yeah and there was something called the crusades for instance tremendous violence many people killed the darn thing went on for thirty years","5596":"and this was before cartoons were invented","5597":"thats right kent so much for your viewpoint","5598":"dr marvin monroe in vienna would you care to comment on all this","5599":"ah well kent to me the high jinks - of a few comic characters absolutely pale in comparison with the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into every day im im referring here to women who love too much fear of winning sexaholism stuff like that","5600":"so you have no professional objection to itchy scratchy","5601":"no not at all in fact one
